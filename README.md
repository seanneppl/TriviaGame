# Trivia Game

[Trivia Game](https://seanneppl.github.io/TriviaGame/index.html) is a jQuery and html5/css web application that prompts the user to guess the song that is currently playing.
The songs are presented in random order each time the game is played and the player is given 30 seconds to guess each song from four options.
Once the player has guessed the answer is revealed and the song fades out for 15 seconds before the next song is played. At the end of the game the players correct answers, wrong answers, and unanswered questions are totalled and displayed.
